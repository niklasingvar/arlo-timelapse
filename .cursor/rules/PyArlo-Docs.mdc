SNAPSHOT OF PyAarlo’s documentation!

Welcome to PyAarlo’s documentation!
PyArlo
class pyaarlo.PyArlo(\*\*kwargs)
Entry point for all Arlo operations.

This is used to login to Arlo, open and maintain an evenstream with Arlo, find and store devices and device state, provide keep-alive services and make sure media sources are kept up to date.

Every device discovered and created is done in here, every device discovered and created uses this instance to log errors, info and debug, to access the state database and configuration settings.

Required `kwargs` parameters:

username - Your Arlo username.
password - Your Arlo password.
Optional `kwargs` parameters:

wait_for_initial_setup - Wait for initial devices states to load before returning from constructor. Default True. Setting to False and using saved state can increase startup time.
last_format - Date string format used when showing video file dates. Default %m-%d %H:%M.
library_days - Number of days of recordings to load. Default is 30. If you have a lot of recordings you can lower this value.
save_state - Store device state across restarts. Default True.
state_file - Where to store state. Default is ${storage_dir}/${name.}pickle
refresh_devices_every - Time, in hours, to refresh the device list from Arlo. This can help keep the login from timing out.
stream_timeout - Time, in seconds, for the event stream to close after receiving no packets. 0 means no timeout. Default 0 seconds. Setting this to 120 can be useful for catching dead connections - ie, an ISP forced a new IP on you.
synchronous_mode - Wait for operations to complete before returing. If you are coming from Pyarlo this will make Pyaarlo behave more like you expect.
save_media_to - Save media to a local directory.
Debug `kwargs` parameters:

dump - Save event stream packets to a file.
dump_file - Where to packets. Default is ${storage_dir}/packets.dump
name - Name used for state and dump files.
verbose_debug - If True, provide extra debug in the logs. This includes packets in and out.
2FA authentication `kwargs` parameters:

These parameters are needed for 2FA.

tfa_source - Where to get the token from. Default is console. Can be imap to use email or rest-api to use rest API website.
tfa_type - How to get the 2FA token delivered. Default is email but can be sms.
tfa_timeout - When using imap or rest-api, how long to wait, in seconds, between checks.
tfa_total_timeout - When using imap or rest-api, how long to wait, in seconds, for all checks.
tfa_host - When using imap or rest-api, host name of server.
tfa_username - When using imap or rest-api, user name on server. If None will use Arlo username.
tfa_password - When using imap or rest-api, password/token on server. If None will use Arlo password.
cipher_list - Set if your IMAP server is using less secure ciphers.
Infrequently used `kwargs` parameters:

These parameters are very rarely changed.

host - Arlo host to use. Default https://my.arlo.com.
storage_dir - Where to store saved state.
db_motion_time - Time, in seconds, to show active for doorbell motion detected. Default 30 seconds.
db_ding_time - Time, in seconds, to show on for doorbell button press. Default 10 seconds.
request_timeout - Time, in seconds, for requests sent to Arlo to succeed. Default 60 seconds.
recent_time - Time, in seconds, for the camera to indicate it has seen motion. Default 600 seconds.
no_media_upload - Force a media upload after camera activity. Normally not needed but some systems fail to push media uploads. Default ‘False’. Deprecated, use media_retry.
media_retry - Force a media upload after camera activity. Normally not needed but some systems fail to push media uploads. An integer array of timeout to use to get the update image. Default ‘[]’.
no_media_upload - Force a media upload after camera activity. Normally not needed but some systems fail to push media uploads. Default ‘False’.
user_agent - Set what ‘user-agent’ string is passed in request headers. It affects what video stream type is returned. Default is arlo.
mode_api - Which api to use to set the base station modes. Default is auto which choose an API based on camera model. Can also be v1, v2 or v3. Use v3 for the new location API.
reconnect_every - Time, in minutes, to close and relogin to Arlo.
snapshot_timeout - Time, in seconds, to stop the snapshot attempt and return the camera to the idle state.
mqtt_host - specify the mqtt host to use, default mqtt-cluster.arloxcld.com
mqtt_hostname_check - disable MQTT host SSL certificate checking, default True
mqtt_transport - specify either websockets or tcp, default tcp
Attributes

Pyaarlo provides an asynchronous interface for receiving events from Arlo devices. To use it you register a callback for an attribute against a device. The following are a list of currently supported attributes:

motionDetected - called when motion start and stops
audioDetected - called when noise starts and stops
activeMode - called when a base changes mode
more to come… - I will flesh this out, but look in const.h for a good idea
You can use the attribute \* to register for all events.
